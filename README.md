# Microservices Architecture Overview

This project demonstrates a microservices architecture built with Spring Cloud, structured into four main components:

## Architecture with Spring Cloud Microservices
Implementation of core microservices such as Customer Service and Inventory Service, establishing the base for distributed services.

## Routing Service (Gateway)
A gateway service that manages dynamic routing and API gateway responsibilities for client requests.

## Service Discovery with Eureka
Integration of Eureka Discovery Service enables automatic registration and discovery of microservices, facilitating dynamic routing and load balancing.

## Configuration Service
A centralized Spring Cloud Config Server manages externalized configuration for all microservices, supporting multiple environments and enabling dynamic refresh of configuration without service restarts.

This modular design ensures scalability, maintainability, and ease of configuration management across diverse environments.
